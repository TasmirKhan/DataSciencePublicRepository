    "\n",
    "For example: To check if a number is even or odd. This can be easily done by using Bitwise-AND(&) operator. If the last bit of the operator is set than it is ODD otherwise it is EVEN. Therefore, if num & 1 not equals to zero than num is ODD otherwise it is EVEN.\n",

    "& (bitwise AND) Takes two numbers as operands and does AND on every bit of two numbers. The result of AND is 1 only if both bits are 1. Suppose A = 5 and B = 3, therefore A & B = 1.\n",
    "| (bitwise OR) Takes two numbers as operands and does OR on every bit of two numbers. The result of OR is 1 if any of the two bits is 1. Suppose A = 5 and B = 3, therefore A | B = 7.\n",

    "<< (left shift) Takes two numbers, left shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift.\n",
    ">> (right shift) Takes two numbers, right shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift.\n",

    "The left shift and right shift operators cannot be used with negative numbers.\n",
    "The bitwise XOR operator is the most useful operator from technical interview perspective. We will see some very useful applications of the XOR operator later in the course.\n",
    "The bitwise operators should not be used in place of logical operators.\n",
    "The left-shift and right-shift operators are equivalent to multiplication and division by 2 respectively.\n",
    "The & operator can be used to quickly check if a number is odd or even. The value of expression (x & 1) would be non-zero only if x is odd, otherwise the value would be zero.\n",

    "comments\n",
    "Let's look at some of the useful tactics of the Bitwise Operators which can be helpful in solving a lot of problems really easily and quickly.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "How to set a bit in the number 'num' : If we want to set a bit at nth position in number 'num' ,it can be done using 'OR' operator( | ).\n",
    "First we left shift '1' to n position via (1 << (n-1))\n",
    "Then, use 'OR' operator to set bit at that position.'OR' operator is used because it will set the bit even if the bit is unset previously in binary representation of number 'num'.\n",
    " \n",
    "How to unset/clear a bit at n'th position in the number 'num' :\n",
    "Suppose we want to unset a bit at nth position in number 'num' then we have to do this with the help of 'AND' (&) operator.\n",
    "First we left shift '1' to n position via (1 << (n-1)) than we use bitwise NOT operator '~' to unset this shifted '1'.\n",
    "Now after clearing this left shifted '1' i.e making it to '0' we will 'AND'(&) with the number 'num' that will unset bit at nth position.\n",
    "\n",
    "      3. Toggling a bit at nth position : Toggling means to turn bit 'on'(1) if it was 'off'(0) and to turn 'off'(0) if it was 'on'(1) previously.We will be using 'XOR' operator here which is this '^'. The reason behind 'XOR' operator is because of its properties. First we left shift '1' to n position via (1 << (n-1)) then XOR the number with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties of 'XOR' operator.\n",
    "1^1 = 0\n",
    "0^0 = 0\n",
    "1^0 = 1\n",
    "0^1 = 1\n",
    "If two bits are different then 'XOR' operator returns a set bit(1) else it returns an unset bit(0).\n",
    " \n",
    "       4. Checking if bit at nth position is set or unset:\n",
    "\n",
    "       1) Left shift given number 1 by n-1 to create a number that has only set bit as n-th bit. temp = 1 << (n-1) \n",
    "\n",
    "       2) If bitwise AND of n and temp is non-zero, then result is SET else result is NOT SET.\n",
    "\n",
    "       The bitwise AND should be between number, temp. As n is the bit here, not number. Simply, if (N & (1 << k)) > 0) its \"Set\".\n",
    "\n",
    "       5. Divide by 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "    x = x >> 1;\n",
    "Logic: When we do arithmetic right shift, every bit is shifted to right and blank position is substituted with sign bit of number, 0 in case of positive and 1 in case of negative number. Since every bit is a power of 2, with each shift we are reducing the value of each bit by factor of 2 which is equivalent to division of x by 2.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    x = 18(00010010)\n",
    "    x >> 1 = 9 (00001001)\n",
    "      6. Multiplying by 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "    x =  << 1;\n",
    "Logic: When we do arithmetic left shift, every bit is shifted to left and blank position is substituted with 0 . Since every bit is a power of 2, with each shift we are increasing the value of each bit by a factor of 2 which is equivalent to multiplication of x by 2.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    x = 18(00010010)\n",
    "    x << 1 = 36 (00100100)\n",

    "    return res; \n",
    "} \n",
    "Logic: We right shift x repeatedly until it becomes 0, meanwhile we keep count on the shift operation. This count value is the log2(x).\n",
    "     8. Flipping the bits of a number: It can be done by a simple way, just simply subtract the number from the value obtained when all the bits are equal to 1 .\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "       Number : Given Number\n",

    "Problem 1: Given a number N, the task is to check whether the given number is a power of 2 or not. \n",

For example, consider 4 ( Binary representation: 100) and 16(Binary representation: 10000), we get following after subtracting 1 from them:\n",
    "3 –> 011\n",
    "15 –> 01111\n",
    "You can clearly see that bitwise-AND(&) of 4 and 3 gives zero, similarly 16 and 15 also gives zero. So, if a number N is a power of 2 then bitwise-AND(&) of N and N-1 will be zero. We can say that N is a power of 2 or not based on the value of N&(N-1).\n",

    "A O(n) time and O(1) extra space solution using XOR: \n",
    "Let the two odd occurring numbers be x and y. We use bitwise XOR to get x and y. We try to make 2 groups such that x and y go to different groups. E.g. [a, a, b, b, x], . Then the problem will become “Find ‘one’ number with odd occurrence in an unsorted array”, which becomes a simple problem and will be solved using XOR. Below are steps to group x and y differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.    The first step is to do XOR of all elements present in array. XOR of all elements gives us XOR of x and y because of the following properties of XOR operation. \n",
    "        1) XOR of any number n with itself gives us 0, i.e., n ^ n = 0 \n",
    "        2) XOR of any number n with 0 gives us n, i.e., n ^ 0 = n \n",
    "        3) XOR is cumulative and associative.\n",
    "\n",
    "        So we have XOR of x and y after the first step, in decimal form. E.g. 5 ^ 6 returns 3, which is computed in bit form as 101 ^ 110 = 011. Let the ‘value’ of XOR be xor2. Every Set bit** in xor2 indicates that ‘the corresponding bits in x and y have values different from each other’ (XOR property- ‘1 when bits are different’). \n",
    "\n",
    "** ( Set-bits are 1’s in binary form. E.g. 101 has 2 set bits(1’s), at 0th index and at 2nd index. )\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if x = 6 (0110) and y = 15 (1111), then xor2 will be (1001), the two set bits in xor2 indicate that the corresponding bits in x and y are different, at 0th index and at 3rd index both. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.    In the second step, we pick a set bit of xor2. Idea is to use the fact that xor2 is ‘1’ in indexes where bits of x and y are different. So we separate x and y to different groups, along with rest of the numbers of list, based on whether the number has same set-bit or not.  \n",
    "\n",
    "     We choose the rightmost set bit of xor2 as it is easy to get rightmost set bit of a number (bit magic). If we bitwise AND a number with its negative counterpart, we get rightmost set bit. (just an observation based property, do remember). So, (xor2) & (-xor2) will give us right set bit. Find (-number) by 2’s complement, that is ((1’s complement) +1 ). It can also be written as (~number)+1. \n",
    "\n",
    "   a)    Example of 2’s complement :\n",
    "\n",
    " 7 is 00111(any no. of preceding zeroes). 1’s complement is obtained by flipping bits , 11000. Then add 1, so 2’s complement of 7 is 11001. Since first bit is 1, its a negative no. \n",
    "\n",
    " (-1)*16 + 1*8 +1*1  =  -7\n",
    "\n",
    "   b)    Example of (number) & (-number) = right set bit :\n",
    "\n",
    " Continuing example of 7,  7 is 00111 and -7 is 11001 , 7 & -7 is  00001. So, rightmost set bit of 7 is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    " Another example with 12 & -12:\n",
    "\n",
    " 12 is 01100 ** and -12 is calculated by flipping digits and adding 1. So, 10011 and adding 1 gives 10100.  12 & -12,  01100 & 10100  gives  00100 as set bit, that is returned as 4 in decimal system, also referred as Set-bit Number here.\n",
    "\n",
    " ** (since number is 32 bit, there are 28 0’s left of ‘left set-bit’, but taking only a few is okay. Positive numbers have leftmost bit 0 and negative have 1 )\n",
    "\n",
    "3.    In third step, we separate x and y in different groups : We now know that for selected set bit index, x and y have different corresponding bits. If we AND all numbers in list with set bit, some will give 0 and others will give 1. We will put all numbers giving zeroes in one group and ones in another. x and y will fall in different groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "Explained with example:-\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g. arr = [4, 2, 4, 10, 2, 3, 3, 12] ,  \n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1) XOR of all in arr will cancel all repeating nos. 10 ^12 will be ans. 1010 ^ 1100 will be 0110 that is xor=6. \n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2) Set bit is 10 from 0110 from visualization. (number) & (-number) is also a quick way to find right set bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "            xor & (-xor) can be coded directly. 6 is 0110 and finding -6 by flipping digits and adding 1, 1001 +1 = 1010.\n",
    "\n",
    "            So 6 AND -6 is essentially 0110 & 1010, that is 0010 i.e. 2 – Set-bit Number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3) AND of all in list with 2 (Set bit no.) will give us numbers that give either 1 or 0, and we make groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "            [4, 4, 12] and [2, 10, 2, 3, 3], giving 0 and 1 respectively on AND with Set-bit number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4) XOR of 1st group will give us x=12, x ^ y is known from 1st step i.e. 6. x ^(x ^y) will give us y. 12 ^6 is 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "           x=12, y=10\n",
    "\n",
    "    This step works because of the same properties of XOR. All the occurrences of a number will go in same set. XOR of all occurrences of a number which occur even number of times will result in 0 in its set. And the xor of a set will be one of the odd occurring elements. \n",
