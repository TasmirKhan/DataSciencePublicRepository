    "Joins in MySQL\n",
    "When we have data split across multiple tables, we use joins to combine that data and get the full picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have two tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "students\n",
    "\n",
    "id\tname\n",
    "1\tAlice\n",
    "2\tBob\n",
    "marks\n",
    "\n",
    "student_id\tsubject\tscore\n",
    "1\tMath\t95\n",
    "2\tMath\t88\n",
    "2\tScience\t90\n",
    "Now let’s see the most common types of joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. INNER JOIN\n",
    "We are telling MySQL to include only the rows that have matching values in both tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT students.name, marks.subject, marks.score\n",
    "FROM students\n",
    "INNER JOIN marks ON students.id = marks.student_id;\n",
    "\n",
    "This will show only students who have marks recorded. If a student has no marks, they will not appear in the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)\n",
    "We are telling MySQL to include all students, even if they don't have any marks. If there's no match in the marks table, it will show NULL.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT students.name, marks.subject, marks.score\n",
    "FROM students\n",
    "LEFT JOIN marks ON students.id = marks.student_id;\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful when we want to list all students, and show marks only if available.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)\n",
    "We are telling MySQL to include all rows from the right table (marks), even if the student is missing from the students table.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT students.name, marks.subject, marks.score\n",
    "FROM students\n",
    "RIGHT JOIN marks ON students.id = marks.student_id;\n",
    "\n",
    "This is rarely used unless we expect some marks that don’t have a student record.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. CROSS JOIN\n",
    "We are telling MySQL to combine every row in the first table with every row in the second table.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT students.name, marks.subject\n",
    "FROM students\n",
    "CROSS JOIN marks;\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this only when you really want all combinations – it can produce a lot of rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary\n",
    "Join Type\tWhat it does\n",
    "INNER JOIN\tOnly rows with a match in both tables\n",
    "LEFT JOIN\tAll rows from the left table, with matched data if any\n",
    "RIGHT JOIN\tAll rows from the right table, with matched data if any\n",
    "CROSS JOIN\tAll combinations of rows from both tables"
