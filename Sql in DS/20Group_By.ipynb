    "GROUP BY in MySQL\n",
    "The GROUP BY clause is used when you want to group rows that have the same values in specified columns.\n",
    "It’s usually combined with aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), or MIN().\n",
    "\n",
    "We are telling MySQL:\n",
    "“Group these rows together by this column, and then apply an aggregate function to each group.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Count of employees in each department\n",
    "SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_employees\n",
    "FROM employees\n",
    "GROUP BY department;\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we’re grouping all employees by their department and counting how many are in each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Average salary per department\n",
    "SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary\n",
    "FROM employees\n",
    "GROUP BY department;\n",
    "\n",
    "We are telling MySQL: “Group the data by department, then calculate the average salary for each group.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Using GROUP BY with Multiple Columns\n",
    "You can group by more than one column to get more detailed groupings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Count by department and job title\n",
    "SELECT department, job_title, COUNT(*) AS count\n",
    "FROM employees\n",
    "GROUP BY department, job_title;\n",
    "\n",
    "This will count how many employees hold each job title within each department.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HAVING Clause\n",
    "Once you've grouped data using GROUP BY, you might want to filter the groups themselves based on the result of an aggregate function. This is where HAVING comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "HAVING is like WHERE, but it works after the grouping is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Departments with more than 5 employees\n",
    "SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total\n",
    "FROM employees\n",
    "GROUP BY department\n",
    "HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;\n",
    "\n",
    "We are telling MySQL: “First group employees by department, then only show those departments where the total number is greater than 5.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference Between WHERE and HAVING\n",
    "Clause\tUsed For\tExample Use\n",
    "WHERE\tFilters rows before grouping\tWHERE salary > 50000\n",
    "HAVING\tFilters groups after grouping\tHAVING AVG(salary) > 60000\n",
    "You can also use both together:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary\n",
    "FROM employees\n",
    "WHERE status = 'active'\n",
    "GROUP BY department\n",
    "HAVING AVG(salary) > 60000;\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what’s happening:\n",
    "\n",
    "WHERE filters only the active employees.\n",
    "GROUP BY groups them by department.\n",
    "HAVING filters out departments with low average salary.\n",
    "Using WITH ROLLUP in MySQL\n",
    "The WITH ROLLUP clause in MySQL is used with GROUP BY to add summary rows (totals and subtotals) to your result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary\n",
    "Keyword\tRole\n",
    "GROUP BY\tGroups rows with same values into summary rows\n",
    "HAVING\tFilters groups based on aggregate results\n",
    "Use GROUP BY when you want to aggregate data. Use HAVING when you want to filter those aggregated groups."
