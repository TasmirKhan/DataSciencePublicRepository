    "Deep Dive into Constraints\n",
    "Constraints in SQL are rules applied to table columns to enforce data integrity, consistency, and validity. They restrict the type of data that can be inserted into a table and help prevent invalid or duplicate entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Use Constraints?\n",
    "Ensure data quality and reliability\n",
    "Prevent invalid, duplicate, or null data\n",
    "Maintain business rules directly in the database layer\n",
    "1. NOT NULL Constraint\n",
    "Ensures that a column cannot contain NULL values.\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    id INT NOT NULL,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case:\n",
    "Make sure critical fields like id, name, or email are always filled.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. UNIQUE Constraint\n",
    "Ensures that all values in a column are distinct (no duplicates).\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE users (\n",
    "    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,\n",
    "    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case:\n",
    "Prevent duplicate usernames or email addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: A table can have multiple UNIQUE constraints, but only one PRIMARY KEY.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. DEFAULT Constraint\n",
    "Sets a default value for a column if none is provided during insert.\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE products (\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'in_stock'\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case:\n",
    "Auto-fill common values to reduce data entry effort and prevent missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. CHECK Constraint\n",
    "Validates that values in a column meet a specific condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE accounts (\n",
    "    id INT,\n",
    "    balance DECIMAL(10,2) CHECK (balance >= 0)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case:\n",
    "Enforce business rules such as non-negative balances or valid age ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: MySQL versions before 8.0 parsed CHECK but did not enforce it. From MySQL 8.0 onwards, CHECK constraints are enforced.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Naming Constraints\n",
    "You can give explicit names to constraints. This makes them easier to reference, especially when altering or dropping them later.\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE students (\n",
    "    roll_no INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    age INT CONSTRAINT chk_age CHECK (age >= 5),\n",
    "    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of Named Constraints:\n",
    "Improves clarity and debugging\n",
    "Useful when using ALTER TABLE to drop constraints\n",
    "6. Constraint Recap Table\n",
    "Constraint\tPurpose\tEnforced By MySQL\tCustom Name Support\n",
    "NOT NULL\tDisallow null values\tYes\tYes\n",
    "UNIQUE\tDisallow duplicate values\tYes\tYes\n",
    "DEFAULT\tSet default value if none given\tYes\tNo\n",
    "CHECK\tEnforce value conditions\tYes (MySQL 8.0+)\tYes\n",
    "Best Practices\n",
    "Use constraints to enforce critical rules in the database layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Always name important constraints for easier maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prefer constraints over application-side validation for core rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test CHECK constraints carefully to ensure compatibility and enforcement in your MySQL version."
