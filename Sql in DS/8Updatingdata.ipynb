    "Updating Data in a Table\n",
    "Today we will learn about how to modify existing data in a table using the UPDATE statement. We will see how to use the SET keyword and how to use the WHERE clause to target specific rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Basic Syntax\n",
    "UPDATE table_name\n",
    "SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...\n",
    "WHERE condition;\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE: Specifies the table you want to modify.\n",
    "SET: Assigns new values to columns.\n",
    "WHERE: Filters which rows should be updated. Always include a WHERE clause unless you want to update all rows.\n",
    "2. Example Table\n",
    "Assume the following student table:\n",
    "\n",
    "id\tname\tage\tgrade\n",
    "1\tAyesha Khan\t16\t10th\n",
    "2\tRavi Sharma\t17\t11th\n",
    "3\tMeena Joshi\t15\t9th\n",
    "3. Update a Single Row\n",
    "Example: Change the grade of student with id = 2 to 12th\n",
    "UPDATE student\n",
    "SET grade = '12th'\n",
    "WHERE id = 2;\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Update Multiple Columns\n",
    "Example: Change age to 17 and grade to '10th' for id = 3\n",
    "UPDATE student\n",
    "SET age = 17, grade = '10th'\n",
    "WHERE id = 3;\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Update All Rows\n",
    "Be careful when updating without a WHERE clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Set all students to age 18\n",
    "UPDATE student\n",
    "SET age = 18;\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning: This will modify every row in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Conditional Update with Comparison Operators\n",
    "Example: Promote all students in 9th grade to 10th grade\n",
    "UPDATE student\n",
    "SET grade = '10th'\n",
    "WHERE grade = '9th';\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Increase age by 1 for students younger than 18\n",
    "UPDATE student\n",
    "SET age = age + 1\n",
    "WHERE age < 18;\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Update Using IS NULL\n",
    "Example: Set default grade to 'Unknown' where grade is NULL\n",
    "UPDATE student\n",
    "SET grade = 'Unknown'\n",
    "WHERE grade IS NULL;\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Verify the Update\n",
    "To check the results:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT * FROM student;"
