    "Views in MySQL\n",
    "A View in MySQL is like a virtual table. It doesn’t store data by itself but instead shows data from one or more tables through a saved SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use a view just like a regular table: SELECT from it, filter it, join it, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Use Views?\n",
    "To simplify complex queries by giving them a name.\n",
    "To hide sensitive columns from users.\n",
    "To show only specific rows/columns from a table.\n",
    "To reuse common query logic across your app or reports.\n",
    "Creating a View\n",
    "Let’s say you have an employees table with lots of details, but you only want to show public employee info (name, department, and salary).\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE VIEW public_employees AS\n",
    "SELECT name, department, salary\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "You’re telling MySQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Create a view called public_employees that shows only name, department, and salary from the employees table.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a View\n",
    "Now you can query it like a normal table:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT * FROM public_employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "Or even apply filters:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT * FROM public_employees\n",
    "WHERE department = 'IT';\n",
    "\n",
    "Updating a View\n",
    "You can replace a view like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public_employees AS\n",
    "SELECT name, department\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropping (Deleting) a View\n",
    "DROP VIEW public_employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "This removes the view from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes\n",
    "Views don’t store data. If the underlying table changes, the view reflects that automatically.\n",
    "Not all views are updatable. Simple views usually are (like those selecting from one table without grouping or joins), but complex ones may not allow INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.\n",
    "Views can make your queries cleaner and easier to maintain.\n",
    "Example Use Case\n",
    "You have this query used 5 times across your app:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT customer_id, name, total_orders, status\n",
    "FROM customers\n",
    "WHERE status = 'active' AND total_orders > 5;\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of repeating it, just create a view:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE VIEW top_customers AS\n",
    "SELECT customer_id, name, total_orders, status\n",
    "FROM customers\n",
    "WHERE status = 'active' AND total_orders > 5;\n",
    "\n",
    "Now just do:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT * FROM top_customers;"
   ]
