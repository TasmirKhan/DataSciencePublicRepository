    "The UNION operator is used to combine the result sets of two or more SELECT statements into a single result.\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps when:\n",
    "\n",
    "You're pulling similar data from different tables.\n",
    "You want to merge results from multiple queries into one list.\n",
    "When UNION Works\n",
    "Same number of columns in all SELECT statements.\n",
    "Compatible data types in corresponding columns.\n",
    "Columns will be matched by position, not by name.\n",
    "SELECT name, city FROM customers\n",

    "\n",
    "Use UNION if:\n",

    "You want a clean list without duplicates.\n",
    "Use UNION ALL if:\n",
    "\n",
    "You want performance and don’t care about duplicates.\n",
    "Or you expect duplicate values and want to preserve them.\n",
    "Practical Use Case Example\n",
    "Let’s say you have two tables: students_2023 and students_2024.\n",

    "You can sort the final output using ORDER BY at the end:\n",
