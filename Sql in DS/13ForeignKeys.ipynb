    "Foreign Keys\n",
    "This guide demonstrates how to create a database, define tables, and use foreign keys to establish relationships between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a Database\n",
    "CREATE DATABASE school;\n",
    "USE school;\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create Tables\n",
    "We'll create two tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "students\n",
    "classes\n",
    "Each student will belong to a class, creating a one-to-many relationship (one class has many students).\n",
    "\n",
    "Create classes Table\n",
    "CREATE TABLE classes (\n",
    "    class_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    class_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "Create students Table\n",
    "CREATE TABLE students (\n",
    "    student_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    student_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n",
    "    class_id INT,\n",
    "    FOREIGN KEY (class_id) REFERENCES classes(class_id)\n",
    "        ON UPDATE CASCADE\n",
    "        ON DELETE SET NULL\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Insert Sample Data\n",
    "Insert into classes\n",
    "INSERT INTO classes (class_name) VALUES ('Mathematics'), ('Science'), ('History');\n",
    "\n",
    "Insert into students\n",
    "INSERT INTO students (student_name, class_id) VALUES \n",
    "('Alice', 1),\n",
    "('Bob', 2),\n",
    "('Charlie', 1);\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Explanation of Foreign Key Behavior\n",
    "In the students table:\n",
    "\n",
    "class_id is a foreign key.\n",
    "It references class_id in the classes table.\n",
    "ON DELETE SET NULL: If a class is deleted, the related students will have class_id set to NULL.\n",
    "ON UPDATE CASCADE: If a class ID changes, it will update automatically in the students table.\n",
    "5. View the Relationships\n",
    "To check the foreign key constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "SHOW CREATE TABLE students;\n",
    "\n",
    "To see all foreign keys in the current database:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    table_name, \n",
    "    column_name, \n",
    "    constraint_name, \n",
    "    referenced_table_name, \n",
    "    referenced_column_name\n",
    "FROM \n",
    "    information_schema.key_column_usage\n",
    "WHERE \n",
    "    referenced_table_name IS NOT NULL\n",
    "    AND table_schema = 'school';\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding ON UPDATE CASCADE and ON DELETE SET NULL\n",
    "When you define a foreign key in MySQL, you can specify what should happen to the child table when the parent table is updated or deleted. These are called referential actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ON UPDATE CASCADE\n",
    "Definition: If the value in the parent table (i.e., the referenced column) is updated, the corresponding foreign key value in the child table is automatically updated to match.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Suppose we update a class_id in the classes table:\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE classes SET class_id = 10 WHERE class_id = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "Then all students in the students table whose class_id was 1 will automatically be updated to 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ON DELETE SET NULL\n",
    "Definition: If a row in the parent table is deleted, the foreign key in the child table will be set to NULL for all matching rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If we delete a class from the classes table:\n",
    "\n",
    "DELETE FROM classes WHERE class_id = 2;\n",
    "\n",
    "Then all students in the students table who were in class 2 will have their class_id set to NULL, indicating that they are no longer assigned to a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Use These Options?\n",
    "ON UPDATE CASCADE is useful when the primary key of the parent table might change (rare but possible).\n",
    "ON DELETE SET NULL is helpful when you want to preserve child records but indicate that the relationship has been broken.\n",
    "Alternatives\n",
    "ON DELETE CASCADE: Deletes the child rows when the parent row is deleted.\n",
    "ON DELETE RESTRICT: Prevents deletion if any child rows exist.\n",
    "ON DELETE NO ACTION: Same as RESTRICT in MySQL.\n",
    "ON DELETE SET DEFAULT: Not supported in MySQL (but available in some other DBMSs)."
