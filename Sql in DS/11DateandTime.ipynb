    "Getting Current Date and Time\n",
    "MySQL provides built-in functions to retrieve the current date, time, and timestamp. These are commonly used in data logging, time-based queries, and tracking records in data science workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CURRENT_DATE\n",
    "Returns the current date in YYYY-MM-DD format.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT CURRENT_DATE;\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "2025-05-02\n",
    "2. CURRENT_TIME\n",
    "Returns the current time in HH:MM:SS format.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT CURRENT_TIME;\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "14:23:45\n",
    "3. CURRENT_TIMESTAMP (or NOW())\n",
    "Returns the current date and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;\n",
    "-- or\n",
    "SELECT NOW();\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "2025-05-02 14:23:45\n",
    "This is especially useful for storing creation or update times in records.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. LOCALTIME and LOCALTIMESTAMP\n",
    "These are synonyms for NOW() and return the current date and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT LOCALTIME;\n",
    "SELECT LOCALTIMESTAMP;\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions return the local date and time of the MySQL server, not the client's time zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important Clarification:\n",
    "The \"local\" in LOCALTIME refers to the time zone configured on the MySQL server, not the user's system.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check the current server time zone using:\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Using in Table Inserts\n",
    "You can use NOW() or CURRENT_TIMESTAMP to auto-fill date-time columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT INTO logs (event, created_at)\n",
    "VALUES ('data_import', NOW());\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Date and Time Functions Recap\n",
    "Function\tReturns\tExample Output\n",
    "CURRENT_DATE\tDate only\t2025-05-02\n",
    "CURRENT_TIME\tTime only\t14:23:45\n",
    "NOW()\tDate and time\t2025-05-02 14:23:45\n",

    "LOCALTIME\tDate and time\t2025-05-02 14:23:45\n",
    "Best Practices\n",
    "Use CURRENT_TIMESTAMP for record timestamps.\n",
    "Use NOW() in queries to filter records by current time.\n",
    "Avoid relying on system time for business logic; prefer database time for consistency."
