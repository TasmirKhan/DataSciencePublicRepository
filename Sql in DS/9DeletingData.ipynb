    "Deleting Data from a Table\n",
    "This guide explains how to remove records from a table using the DELETE statement. It covers deleting specific rows using the WHERE clause and the consequences of deleting all rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Basic Syntax\n",
    "DELETE FROM table_name\n",
    "WHERE condition;\n",
    "\n",
    "DELETE FROM: Specifies the table from which to remove rows.\n",
    "WHERE: Filters which rows should be deleted.\n",
    "Important: If you omit the WHERE clause, all rows in the table will be deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Example Table\n",
    "Assume the following student table:\n",
    "\n",
    "id\tname\tage\tgrade\n",
    "1\tAyesha Khan\t16\t10th\n",
    "2\tRavi Sharma\t17\t12th\n",
    "3\tMeena Joshi\t15\t9th\n",
    "3. Delete a Specific Row\n",
    "Example: Delete student with id = 2\n",
    "DELETE FROM student\n",
    "WHERE id = 2;\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Delete Rows Based on a Condition\n",
    "Example: Delete all students in 9th grade\n",
    "DELETE FROM student\n",
    "WHERE grade = '9th';\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Delete Rows Using Comparison Operators\n",
    "Example: Delete all students younger than 16\n",
    "DELETE FROM student\n",
    "WHERE age < 16;\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Delete Rows Where a Column is NULL\n",
    "Example: Delete students with no grade assigned\n",
    "DELETE FROM student\n",
    "WHERE grade IS NULL;\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Delete All Rows (Use with Caution)\n",
    "Example: Remove all data from the student table\n",
    "DELETE FROM student;\n",
    "\n",
    "This deletes all rows but retains the table structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Completely Remove the Table\n",
    "To delete the table itself (not just the data), use:\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE student;\n",
    "\n",
    "This removes both the data and the table structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Verify After Deletion\n",
    "Check the contents of the table:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT * FROM student;"
